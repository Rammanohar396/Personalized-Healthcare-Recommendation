# Personalized-Healthcare-Recommendation

# Description

The Personalized Healthcare Recommendations project aims to develop a machine
learning model that provides tailored healthcare recommendations based on individual
patient data. This can include recommendations for lifestyle changes, preventive
measures, medications, or treatment plans. The goal is to improve patient outcomes by
leveraging data-driven insights to offer personalized advice.

# About Dataset
Blood datasets typically encompass a broad array of information related to hematology,
blood chemistry, and related health indicators. These datasets often include data points
such as blood cell counts, hemoglobin levels, hematocrit, platelet counts, white blood
cell differentials, and various blood chemistry parameters such as glucose, cholesterol,
and electrolyte levels.
